In order to better facilitate building our kernel and system images, as well as running our emulators, we developed a set of scripts to simplify the process.
We also gathered the patches we needed in order to get the build compiling successfully and included them in our repository so we can more easily duplicate our efforts. 
We published all of the source on Github and hope to improve them and contribute them to the Android community.\cite{lindiakos_github_2012}
