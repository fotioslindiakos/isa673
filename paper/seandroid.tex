\ac{seandroid} is a project to identify and address critical gaps in the security of Android.
Initially, the \ac{seandroid} project is enabling the use of \ac{selinux} in Android in order to limit the damage that can be done by flawed or malicious apps and in order to enforce separation guarantees between apps.
The current \ac{seandroid} reference implementation provides a worked example of how to enable and apply \ac{selinux} at the lower layers of the Android software stack and provides a working demonstration of the value provided by \ac{selinux} in confining various root exploits and application vulnerabilities.
